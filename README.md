# kicad_templates
Kicad templates that I use regularly
## checkout notes
This repository contains a few submodules, so after checking out do not forget to also check out the submodules.
```
git clone https://github.com/Squantor/LPC-breakout-boards.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Submodules are my private kicad library that are used in my projects. I do try to use the kicad components as much as possible but for certain component types they are less then optimal or they do not exist.
